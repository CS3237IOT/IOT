# NUS CS3237 Internet of Things Final Project
### Done by: Qing Bowen, Tsai Ming Chin, Mao Yiru, Lian Jiade


1. `IOT_project` Repository contains python scripts for laptop to receive sensor data from TI CC2650 SensorTags for data pre-processing, Machine learning prediction and upload of firebase Real-Time Database 
2. `IOTAPP` Repository contains Java code for the Android App which displays real-time data of your current physical activity and long-term storage of past exercise data 
3. `ActivityRecognition_ML` Repository contains machine learning model for fitness activity recognition using accelerometer and gyrometer data 
4. `HeatInjury_ML` Repository contains machine learning model for heat injury risk warning using temperature and humudity data
